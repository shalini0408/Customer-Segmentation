# Customer-Segmentation
Customer Segmentation is a way of dividing the customers into groups that share similar characteristics. The data-set chosen is extracted from the Machine learning repository. This implementation uses many different approaches to classify customers into different categories-Newbie, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Old_platinum and Chance customers -after preprocessing the extracted data. Customer Analysis is done using Cohort Analysis and RFM scores. The RFM scores are then further used to create clusters using k-means. The main purpose of this analysis is to help the business better understand its customers and therefore conduct customer-centric marketing more effectively.
